# Reliability Plot Example

This example demonstrates how to aggregate data from MET stat files and generate a reliability plot using VCasT. The process is divided into two main steps:

## Data Aggregation:
This step processes the MET stat files and aggregates the data into output files. One of these files contains the aggregated statistics needed to create the plot.

## Plot Generation:
This step uses the aggregated output file to create a reliability plot that visually compares forecast probabilities to observed frequencies.

## Commands

1. Aggregate Data
Run the following command to process the MET stat files. This command will generate two output files, including one with aggregated data for further analysis.

```bash
# Aggregates MET stat files and creates output files with aggregated data
vcast config_reliability.yaml
```

2. Generate the Reliability Plot
Once the data aggregation is complete, run the following command to generate the reliability plot using the aggregated data:

```bash
Copy
# Generates the reliability plot using the aggregated output file
vcast plot.yaml
```
