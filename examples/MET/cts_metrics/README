# Creating a Plot with CTS Line Type Metrics
This example demonstrates how to aggregate data from MET stat files to compute cts (contingency table statistics) metrics—such as FBIAS, PODY, FAR, and CSI—and then plot them with VCasT.

1. Data Aggregation
### Configuration:
  config_cts.yaml is the configuration file that tells VCasT which MET stat files to process and which CTS metrics to compute or extract (e.g., FBIAS, PODY, FAR, CSI).
  
  Run VCasT to Aggregate Data:

```bash
vcast config_cts.yaml
```
This command processes the MET stat files, aggregates the relevant CTS metrics, and outputs one data file for plotting.

2. Plot Generation
### Plot Configuration:

  plot.yaml defines how to visualize the aggregated data, specifying line colors, markers, labels, and other plot properties.

  Run VCasT to Generate the Plot:

```bash
vcast plot.yaml
```
This command reads the aggregated data file from the previous step and creates a line plot showing each CTS metric over the chosen axis (e.g., lead time).
